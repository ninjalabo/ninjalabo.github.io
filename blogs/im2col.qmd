The difference you're referring to is between **factorization in im2col + matrix multiplication** and **factorization methods applied within CNN models themselves**. These are distinct techniques for reducing the computational cost of convolutions, and the main difference lies in **what is being factorized** and **how the factorization is used**.

### 1. **Factorization in CNN Models (Model-level factorization)**

**CNN model factorization** refers to the techniques used to directly reduce the computational complexity of the CNN itself. This is typically done by factorizing the convolutional layers **inside the model**. The two main types of factorization used here are:

- **Low-rank decomposition** of convolutional kernels (weight tensors).
- **Spatial factorization** of the convolutional operation (e.g., breaking a 3x3 filter into 3x1 and 1x3 filters).

In CNN model factorization:
- The goal is to reduce the number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs) in the model.
- Factorization happens **on the convolutional filters or operations** themselves, **not the input data**.
- The factorization is applied **directly to the layers** during the training process to create a more efficient CNN model.

For example, a typical \(3 \times 3\) filter could be factorized into two smaller filters (\(3 \times 1\) and \(1 \times 3\)), which significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations without changing the structure of the input data.

### 2. **Factorization in im2col + Matrix Multiplication (Input-level factorization)**

In the **im2col + matrix multiplication approach**, the factorization applies to **how the input data is transformed** rather than the model itself.

Here’s what happens:
- The input image or feature map is **flattened into columns** using the im2col operation, which takes overlapping sliding windows from the image and stores them as columns in a large matrix.
- Once the input is reshaped into this matrix, the convolutional operation is computed as a **matrix multiplication** between the im2col-transformed input and the flattened filter weights.
- The purpose is to **reformulate** the convolution into a matrix multiplication so that highly optimized matrix libraries (like BLAS) can be used to perform the operation efficiently.

In this case:
- The **input data** is reshaped into a matrix; **the model architecture is not changed**.
- There is **no factorization** happening within the model itself (i.e., no decomposition of the convolutional filters).
- This technique is purely a computational optimization that speeds up the execution of convolution by transforming it into a matrix multiplication problem.

### Key Differences Between CNN Model Factorization and im2col + Matrix Multiplication

| Aspect                         | CNN Model Factorization                          | im2col + Matrix Multiplication                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is Factorized?**         | The **convolutional filters** or convolutional operation (within the model) | The **input data** is reshaped (input-to-column transformation), no change to the model |
| **Focus**                       | Reduce model complexity by directly decomposing the convolutional layer (kernels or spatial structure) | Reformulate convolution as matrix multiplication for computational efficiency |
| **Where Factorization Occurs**  | Inside the CNN model (on the convolutional layers) | On the input image/feature map (before applying convolution) |
| **Goal**                        | Reduce number of parameters, FLOPs, and model size | Leverage highly optimized matrix multiplication routines for faster execution |
| **Memory Overhead**             | Lower memory usage due to fewer parameters (depending on factorization type) | Higher memory usage because input data is flattened into large matrices |
| **Accuracy Impact**             | Might introduce small accuracy loss if not carefully fine-tuned | No accuracy loss, since it’s just a reformulation of the convolution operation |
| **Use Case**                    | Best for reducing model size and complexity (e.g., mobile devices, real-time applications) | Best for GPU-accelerated environments with large batch sizes and optimized matrix multiplication libraries |

### Summary:

- **CNN Model Factorization** is about **directly reducing the size and complexity of the CNN model** by factorizing convolutional layers. It operates at the **model level**, modifying how convolutional operations are performed or approximating the filters themselves. This approach leads to smaller models with fewer computations but may introduce some accuracy trade-offs.
  
- **im2col + Matrix Multiplication** is about **transforming the input data** to make the convolution operation more computationally efficient by using fast matrix multiplication libraries. It operates at the **input level**, does not change the model architecture, and does not affect accuracy, but it can result in high memory usage due to the large intermediate matrices generated by im2col.

In short, **CNN factorization** changes how the model works, while **im2col** changes how the data is processed for efficient computation.
